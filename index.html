      <p>Without horses we would not live in the world we do today.
         Horses have not only shaped the world of our imagination, but also 
         the very roads on which we drive to work were 9 times of 10 were first
         marked by hoofprints.</p>

      <div class="section-two">
      <p>In the west the prints of their hooves are as indelible as those of the awesome Bison, their manes flying into the wind and alert eyes, iconic
        as the American Eagle.</p>

      <div class="section-three">

         place in the country an honored place in our ecosystem can not be understated.</p>
